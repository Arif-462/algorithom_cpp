    Graph : Node and Edge together is called is graph

    Variations of graph : Weighted graph and Unweighted graph

    weighted graph : Which edge is assign any number.
    unweighted graph : Which edge is not  assign any number

    undirected graph : which graph edge is not directed is called undirected graph.
    directed graph : edge is directed is called is directed graph.

    Another is directed weighted graph and undirected unweighted graph
