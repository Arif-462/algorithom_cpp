/*
    when any programe solve by divide into a small sub problem
    then use  dynamic programe.

    principle of dynamic probem of working :

    1. Define the state// when a parameter send to a function is called state.
        example: fib(n) here n is the state;

    2. Identify the recursive equation from the smaller subproblems
    3. Define base cases.




    Method of dynamic problem:

    1. memorization / recursive / top- down

    2. Tabulation / Iteration / bottom-up
