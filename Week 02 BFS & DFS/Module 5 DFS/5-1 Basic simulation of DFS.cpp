    =========================
    step of DFS
    ---------
    -> select a node
    -> explore a node;
        >when we explore a node and then if see a new node which is not
        visited previously then pause the current node and go to the next node
        and continue this process. after the finish of explore then back the track
        and back to previous.

        then finally back to first and continue this process to other side.
